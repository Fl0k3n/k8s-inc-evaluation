All tests from both TCP elephant flow senders

- we have 1000kBps
- we send 100kBps HTTP from sender to both rcvrs

1. constant flow of 1000kBps from both elephants flows (1716137072023787559)
2. constant flow of 1100kBps (1716137116382696201)
3. constant flow of 1200kBps (1716137144622187949)
4. increasing flow from 700kBps to 1500kBps 100kBps increase each second (1716137206155300972)
5. fluctuating flows from 700kBps to 1500kBps (1716137232641267087)
